# Specification Quality Checklist: H3M Hologram Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Specifies "Unity" and "AR Foundation" as they are platform constraints, but avoids code.*
- [x] Focused on user value (Holograms, Immersion)
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (mostly)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable (FPS, Particle Counts)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (mostly)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (occluded camera)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (Phase 1 & 2 only)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (Metavido reference)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes
- Ready for Planning.
