    The system uses the
    original instanced grass script with a new material that handles the textured
    aspect


    There is also a new system to occlude the grass, using the OCCLUDE
    culling compute shader


    The top down depth camera is rendering to a texture
    the scene depth and passes the result using the "_ShoreContourTex" texture name
    in the grass shader. Objects in the depth render layers will occlude the grass.
    The grass material must also be referenced in the materials list in the depth
    render script in the right.


    The system updates as player moves a distance


    The
    grass adapts to the terrain based on the same top down depth texture and will
    be applied on any objects in the Terrain layer, the occluders must be set very
    high so are used as occluders instead of grass be moved on their surface. the
    Depth cutoff height dictates where the cutoff of occluders will happen
